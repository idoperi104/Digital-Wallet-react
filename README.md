# Digital Wallet React

This is a simple web frontend application for managing your digital wallet. The frontend is built using React and styled using SCSS.

You can try out the application by visiting the [project website](https://idoperi104.github.io/Digital-Wallet-react/).

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine. Once you have installed Node.js, clone this repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Then run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the following command to start the application:
